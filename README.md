# odin-calculator
This is written halfway through the project. There are some skills that I enjoyed practicing such as doing
the algorithm to make the calculator work. I spend time stuck on it but had fun trying different ways to make
it work and using pseudo code to work it out. It is definitely an experience to overcome a challenge.

Some things that I need to continue on this project is:
- fixing bugs
- creating error catches
